# 2.5 Credential Recovery Requirements§1§1§11§fs§fxsdfaq	aaq`

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 2.4.1 | Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation or password hashing function. Key derivation and password hashing functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 250 |
|  2.4.2 | Verify that the salt is at least 32 bits in length and be chosen arbitrarily to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes. For each credential, a unique salt value and the resulting hash SHALL be stored. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
|  2.4.3 | Verify that if PBKDF2 is used, the iteration count SHOULD be as large as verification server performance will allow, typically at least 100,000 iterations| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
| 2.4.4 | Verify that if bcrypt is used, the work factor SHOULD be as large as verification server performance will allow, typically at least 13.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 250 |
|  2.4.5 | Verify that an additional iteration of a key derivation function is performed, using a salt value that is secret and known only to the verifier. Generate the salt value using an approved random bit generator [SP 800-90Ar1] and provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of SP 800-131A. The secret salt value SHALL be stored separately from the hashed passwords (e.g., in a specialized device like a hardware security module). | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
